                        <p>
                            Participating in the Programme is solely to refer people to the services listed on our Platform and receive a commission, token, point or discount when anyone you referred has successfully made a Completed Transaction using your Referral Link for the first time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Client Referral & Reward Scheme: 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>The Action:</b> As a Referrer, use your Referral Link to invite friends, family and colleagues to use the ToNote platform, subscribe to the ToNote plans, and successfully complete their transaction(s) on the ToNote platform.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>The Reward:</b> As a Referrer, earn 1 Point in your ToNote Wallet, when a Referred Person makes their first Completed Transaction on the Platform. The more persons your refer the more points you earn as they each complete their first transaction. 1 Point equals N50. Redeem your accumulated points from every Referred Person who becomes a Transacting Client, and use that to pay for your personal transactions on the Platform.
                        </p>

                        <p><b>How to become a Referrer:</b> Any Transacting Client can refer other persons.</p>
                        
                        <p>Agent Referral & Reward Scheme</p>

                        <p>
                        <b>The Action:</b> As a Referral Agent, use your Referral Link or QR Code to invite customers to use the ToNote platform, subscribe to the ToNote plans, and successfully complete their transaction (s) on the ToNote platform.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <b>The Reward:</b> As a Referral Agent, you will earn N500 commission when a Referred Person makes their first Completed Transaction on the Platform. You, the Referral Agent will earn N100 from each subsequent Completed Transaction made by the same Referred Person within three (3) months after their first completed transaction. The more persons your refer the more stipulated commission you earn as they each complete their first and recurring transaction within three months..
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        <b>How to become a Referral Agent:</b> Any person can choose to become a Referral Agent with ToNote without necessarily being a Transacting Client. However, a person must be registered with ToNote and given Referral Agent Particulars before they can act as a Referral Agent.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        A Referral Agent may request for the status of and the accrued earning in their Referral Account on the last working day of a calendar month. Only valid commission or accrued earnings can be redeemed or paid out. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Commission payments will only be made available for Completed Transactions. We reserve the right to determine what qualifies as a Completed Transaction and which Completed Transaction was the first transaction by a Referred Person. You will have no legal recourse against us for determining whether a person you referred to use the Platform made a Completed Transaction
